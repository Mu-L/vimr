## About

VimR is a Neovim GUI for macOS written in Swift.

The goal is to build an editor that uses Neovim inside with some of the convenient
GUI features similar to those present in other editors.

There are other Neovim GUIs for macOS,
see the [list](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/wiki/Related-projects#gui), so why VimR?

- Play around with [Neovim](https://github.com/qvacua/neovim),
- Play around with the main idea of Redux architecture, and
- (most importantly) have fun!

## Download

Pre-built Universal signed and notarized binaries can be found under [Releases](https://github.com/qvacua/vimr/releases).

## Requirements

- macOS 13.0 or later
- Development: Xcode 26

## Reusable Components

VimR is built with a modular architecture. The following Swift packages can be used independently:

* [NvimView](https://github.com/qvacua/vimr/tree/master/NvimView): SwiftPM module containing an NSView which bundles everything needed to embed Neovim in a Cocoa app, including the Neovim binary and runtime files.
* [NvimApi](https://github.com/qvacua/vimr/tree/master/NvimApi): Synchronous and asynchronous API for Neovim.
* [Commons](https://github.com/qvacua/vimr/tree/master/Commons): Common utilities and helpers used across the project.
* [Tabs](https://github.com/qvacua/vimr/tree/master/Tabs): Tab bar component.
* [Workspace](https://github.com/qvacua/vimr/tree/master/Workspace): Workspace management component.
* [Ignore](https://github.com/qvacua/vimr/tree/master/Ignore): Gitignore-style pattern matching using [wildmatch](https://github.com/davvid/wildmatch).

## Features

* Markdown preview
* Generic HTML preview (retains the scroll position when reloading)
* Fuzzy file finder a la Xcode's "Open Quickly..."
* Trackpad support: Pinching for zooming and two-finger scrolling.
* Ligatures: Turned off by default. Turn it on in the Preferences.
* Command line tool.
* (Simple) File browser
* Flexible workspace model a la JetBrain's IDEs
